# Rejected Directions

## ExamInk-Seg Direct / Mask-Only Adaptation

Rejected for current product path. Direct ExamInk partial and mixed updates made the model overly conservative. Mask-only updates worsened hardcase residual.

## Patent-Style Standalone Mask Calibration

Rejected as a standalone branch. SCUT pseudo-mask heads-only training worsened hardcase residual, indicating isolated mask branch tuning breaks erase gating.

## Whiteout Inpaint Repair

Metric-positive but visually rejected. The current local inpaint approach can make correction-fluid areas look dirtier / less natural than the unmodified second-stage output.
